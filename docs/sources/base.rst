Buildings
**********

A description of the different buildings can be found here. The models ``SmartlabThermal-v0`` and ``SmartlabGrid-v0``, ``SeilabThermal-v0`` and ``SeilabGrid-v0``, and ``SeminarcenterThermostat-v0`` and ``SeminarcenterFull-v0`` are based on the same buildings respectively, but differ in the controllability.

For each model we define an evaluation scenario that includes the tracked KPIs, the evaluation weather file and the evaluation interval. These fixed scenarios should be used to evaluate the control performance on a specific building model.
